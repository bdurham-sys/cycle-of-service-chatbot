# APPRENTI CYCLE OF SERVICE FRAMEWORK

## Purpose
A Cycle of Service documents every customer touchpoint from initial inquiry through program completion, ensuring consistent, exceptional experiences that drive apprentice and employer success.

## Key Components

### 1. Customer Touchpoints
Every interaction point where the customer (apprentice or employer) engages with Apprenti services. These must be:
- Clearly defined
- Sequentially organized
- Comprehensive (no gaps)
- Aligned with customer journey stages

### 2. ✨ WOW Moments
Specific actions or experiences that exceed customer expectations and create memorable, positive impressions. WOW moments should:
- Be intentional and planned
- Create emotional connection
- Differentiate Apprenti from competitors
- Be measurable in impact
- Occur at strategic points in the journey

**Examples of WOW Moments:**
- Personalized welcome package with handwritten note
- Surprise check-in call after first week
- Celebration of milestone achievements
- Customized employer success story sharing
- Immediate response to urgent needs

### 3. 📊 Measurable Actions
Specific, quantifiable steps that can be tracked and evaluated. Every measurable action must include:
- Clear success criteria
- Defined timeline
- Responsible party
- Method of measurement
- Target outcome

**Examples of Measurable Actions:**
- "Send welcome email within 24 hours of enrollment (Track: email delivery rate)"
- "Complete employer intake call within 3 business days (Track: call completion rate, scheduling speed)"
- "Achieve 90% apprentice satisfaction score on onboarding survey (Track: survey scores monthly)"

## Usage Guidelines

When creating or reviewing a Cycle of Service:

1. **Start with the customer perspective:** Map the journey as they experience it

3. **Include timing:** Specify when things happen and how long they take
4. **Assign ownership:** Every touchpoint needs a responsible party
5. **Make it measurable:** Include metrics that can track success
6. **Plan WOW moments strategically:** They should align with high-impact points
7. **Check for gaps:** Ensure no customer journey stage is missing
8. **Validate with stakeholders:** Review with teams who execute the service

## Visual Format Standards

When presenting Cycles of Service:
- Use clear headers for each stage
- Indent touchpoints under stages
- Use the ✨ emoji to mark WOW moments (makes them visually distinct)
- Use the 📊 emoji to mark Measurable Actions (makes them visually distinct)
- Use bullet points for action details
- Include white space for readability
- Bold key terms (Timing, Responsibility, etc.)

This visual distinction ensures that WOW moments and Measurable Actions stand out immediately when reviewing the document.
