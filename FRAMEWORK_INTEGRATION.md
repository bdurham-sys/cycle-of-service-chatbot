# ✨ Updated: Official Cycles of Service™ Framework Integration

Your chatbot has been updated to follow the official **Cycles of Service™ framework** by Ruby Newell-Legner of 7 Star Service, incorporating your exact guidelines and template format.

## 🎯 What's New

### 1. Official Framework Integration

The AI now follows these core principles:

**Cycles of Service™ Framework:**
- Complete series of interactions from first contact through follow-up
- Each step from CUSTOMER'S VIEWPOINT (not internal operations)
- Each step MUST start with ACTION WORD (Receive, Submit, Attend, etc.)
- Each step describes ONE touchpoint only
- Simple language, minimal verbiage

**Moments of Truth:**
- Any interaction leaving a lasting impression (positive or negative)

**Touchpoints:**
- Essential building blocks of customer experience
- Any moment customer connects with organization

### 2. Template-Matched Output Format

The output now matches your exact Word template with **3 columns**:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Customer's Steps** (from customer perspective, action word bolded) | **Measurable Standards** (with Apprenti WOW practices & Measurements) | **Regulations/Compliance** |

### 3. Enhanced Measurable Standards

Standards now follow your guidelines to be:
- ✓ Specific, measurable behaviors (not operational procedures)
- ✓ Action verbs and observable behaviors
- ✓ Answer "Was it done or not?"
- ✓ Include: greeting/farewell, appreciation, communication, promptness, accuracy, personalization, empathy
- ✓ Avoid vague or ambiguous language

### 4. Two User Modes

The chatbot automatically detects which mode users need:

**GUIDED MODE** - For users who need help from scratch:
- Minimal content uploaded
- AI walks them through step-by-step
- Asks specific questions to build each step
- Helps brainstorm ideas
- Ensures framework compliance

**NOTES MODE** - For users with detailed drafts:
- Substantial content uploaded
- AI identifies steps from their notes
- Creates measurable standards
- Adds Apprenti WOW practices
- Checks against all guidelines
- Makes suggestions if vague

## 🚀 How to Use the Two Modes

### Scenario 1: Starting from Scratch (Guided Mode)

**What to upload:**
- Brief description of service
- Notes about what you're trying to accomplish
- Rough ideas or bullet points

**What happens:**
1. AI detects limited content
2. Switches to Guided Mode
3. Asks you specific questions like:
   - "What's the first thing a customer does?"
   - "What happens next from their perspective?"
   - "How should staff respond at this point?"
4. Helps you craft each step following framework
5. Suggests WOW practices
6. Defines measurements together

**Example conversation:**
```
AI: "I see you're working on apprentice onboarding. Let's build this 
    step by step. What's the very first action an apprentice takes 
    when they've been accepted into the program?"

You: "They get an email from us"

AI: "Great! Let's frame this from their perspective with an action 
    word. How about: 'Receive acceptance notification'? 
    
    Now, what specific standards should we have for this email?
    For example:
    - When should it be sent?
    - What tone should it have?
    - What information must it include?"
```

### Scenario 2: Refining Existing Work (Notes Mode)

**What to upload:**
- Detailed process document
- Existing SOPs or procedures
- Training materials
- Step descriptions

**What happens:**
1. AI detects substantial content
2. Switches to Notes Mode
3. Automatically:
   - Identifies steps
   - Reframes from customer perspective
   - Adds action words
   - Creates measurable standards
   - Suggests WOW practices
   - Defines measurements
   - Checks compliance
4. Highlights what needs refining

**Example:**
```
You upload: "Staff send welcome email. Schedule orientation. 
            Give them paperwork."

AI generates:
Step 1: Receive welcome email
Standards:
• Email sent within 24 hours of acceptance
• Includes personalized greeting with apprentice's name
• Contains clear next steps and contact information
• Professional yet warm tone

Apprenti WOW:
• Include 30-second personalized video from their assigned mentor
• Attach digital welcome packet with company swag info

Measurements:
• Track email send time in CRM (target: 100% within 24 hours)
• Survey: "Email was clear and welcoming" (target: 4.5/5)
```

## 📊 Quality Assurance Features

### Automatic Compliance Checking
Before finalizing, the AI validates:
1. **Action Word Check**: Does each step start with a verb?
2. **Perspective Check**: Is it from customer viewpoint?
3. **Specificity Check**: Are standards measurable?
4. **Completeness Check**: Are WOW practices concrete?
5. **Measurement Check**: Is tracking defined?

### Vague Language Detection
The AI catches and fixes:
- ❌ "Be friendly" → ✓ "Greet by name within 3 seconds with smile and eye contact"
- ❌ "Quick response" → ✓ "Return phone calls within 2 business hours"
- ❌ "High quality" → ✓ "Zero errors in apprentice paperwork (100% accuracy)"

### Missing Element Alerts
The AI identifies when you're missing:
- Customer touchpoints (gaps in journey)
- Measurements (how to track success)
- WOW opportunities (moments to exceed expectations)
- Regulations (compliance requirements)

A: Yes! It will reframe steps from customer perspective, add action words, make standards measurable, and ensure compliance.
