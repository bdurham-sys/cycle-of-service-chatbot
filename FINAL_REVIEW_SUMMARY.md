## ⚡ Performance Expectations

### This is NORMAL and expected:

**Initial Document Analysis:**
- **Time:** 10-30 seconds
- **Why:** AI processes entire document through framework
- **User Experience:** Loading spinner with message

**Chat Responses:**
- **Time:** 3-10 seconds
- **Why:** AI generates thoughtful, framework-compliant responses
- **User Experience:** Animated "Thinking..." indicator

**Word Export:**
- **Time:** 1-2 seconds
- **Why:** Document generated server-side
- **User Experience:** Nearly instant

### Why NOT Faster?

Your app uses advanced AI (Claude Sonnet 4) to:
1. Analyze documents against framework rules
2. Generate specific, measurable standards
3. Suggest concrete WOW practices
4. Validate compliance
5. Provide intelligent suggestions

This thoughtful analysis takes time - **and that's a good thing!** 
The quality of output justifies the wait.

### Users Won't Mind Because:
✓ Clear loading messages tell them what to expect
✓ They're getting high-quality, framework-compliant output
✓ They can chat to refine (which is faster)
✓ Alternative would be hours of manual work
